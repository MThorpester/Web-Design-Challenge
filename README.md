# Web-Design-Challenge
In this project I designed and deployed a website describing our Data Analytics Bootcamp project "Anxiety and Depression in the time of COVID-19" using GitHub Pages, Bootstrap, Python, HTML and CSS.<br>
- The site is live and can be accessed at https://mthorpester.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
- Details about the original project are available here: https://github.com/isdicely/Project-1#ucd-bootcamp-data-analytics---project-1-anxiety-and-depression-in-the-time-of-covid-19

## Structure of the Repository
- <b>Web-Design-Challenge/</b> (root folder) contains the main index.html file which redirects to html files in the WebVisualizations folder
- <b>WebVisualizations/</b> contains:
    - the rest of the html files, and the Jupyter Notebook used to generate the html for the data table,
    - <b>assets/</b> contains all image and csv files
    - <b>css/</b> contains stylesheets for Bootstrap, for the Heroic Features template, and for a couple of personal customizations of my own.
